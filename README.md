# CS4423-Amontillado
A Unity Project called Amontillado, this game revolves around an urban explorer who falls deep into the Paris Catacombs while exploring and has to fight his way through the undead to make his way out.


### Created by: Ramiro Mendez, Gabriel Pastelero, Faisal Najjar, Minh Le, Ryan Harris

#### Current Stage:
* The project is coming together as expected with enemies, enemies’ attack player’s health bar, and very two different catacomb stages where the player can teleport to and explore.
* The demo has all the basic mechanics as of mention in the GDD such as survival, PVE and mysterious.
* The first scene of the game (Gabriel’s Scene) focuses on exploring and find the exist to the next floor. The second scene focuses on avoiding enemies’ attack to survive.


#### Expectation:
 * In the future, the game is expected to have more stages with different terranes, enemies, weapons, as well as fight mechanics for players

#### Instruction: 
* The movement has a friendly input which most modern games currently have. To move the character, players need to use arrows key (WASD), spacebar to jump, move mouse to look around.
* To advance to the next level, players need go to the exit room in Gabriel’s scene and jump over a wall named “Finish Cube”. To loop back to first scene from second scene, players need to go to the boss room and touch the cube in order to teleport back.
