### Created by: Ramiro Mendez, Gabriel Pastelero, Faisal Najjar, Minh Le, Ryan Harris

#### Current Stage:
* The project is coming together as expected with enemies, enemies’ attack player’s health bar, and very two different catacomb stages where the player can teleport to and explore.
* The demo has all the basic mechanics as of mention in the GDD such as survival, PVE and mysterious.
* The first scene of the game (Gabriel’s Scene) focuses on exploring and find the exist to the next floor. The second scene focuses on avoiding enemies’ attack to survive.


#### Expectation:
 * In the future, the game is expected to have more stages with different terranes, enemies, weapons, as well as fight mechanics for players![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90067776/169108663-e3abae60-f383-423b-81f7-44f93a34e006.png)

#### Instruction: 
* The movement has a friendly input which most modern games currently have. To move the character, players need to use arrows key (WASD), spacebar to jump, move mouse to look around.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90067776/169108744-4f903cb2-43c6-4fa2-8341-ab2ee7ff6ba3.png)
* To advance to the next level, players need go to the exit room in Gabriel’s scene and jump over a wall named “Finish Cube”. To loop back to first scene from second scene, players need to go to the boss room and touch the cube in order to teleport back.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90067776/169108776-d21b753c-657a-407a-81eb-4791e50fb6d9.png)
